The files that are in this folder should work to help you setup a nodered flow
for Relayr. The flow works with the IFM AY1020 and the following IFM sensors:  
UGT509 (Ultrasonic Sensor)  
TA2105 (Temperature Sensor)  
KQ5100 (Capacitive Sensor)  
  
You will need to edit flows components once you import the flow - primarily the  
IP address of the AY1020 as well as the device ID, username, and password  
(others may need reviewing as well before the flow connects to Relayr)
