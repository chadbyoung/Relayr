  Redis is often referred as a data structures server. What this means is
  that Redis provides access to mutable data structures via a set of
  commands, which are sent using a server-client model with TCP sockets and
  a simple protocol. So different processes can query and modify the same
  data structures in a shared way.

  Redis is qithout doubt one of the most popular data stores for scale-out
  cloud architectures.
