# Relayr Edge Agent Snap  
This REPO holds code for two separate tasks. The first task is the deployment
of a Node-Red snap that will work on a Dell Edge Gateway using Ubuntu Core 16.
The second task is to hold scripts and information on how to create a docker
image that will be hosted on a Dell Edge Gateway using Ubuntu Core 16.  


### Code Status = In Development

### Use of the software:  
The applications and/or scripts in this GitHub account are meant to be used as
a reference on how-to create snaps for Ubuntu Core. DO NOT USE this code in a
production environment. As with anything you find on the internet please proceed
